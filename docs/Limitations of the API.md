# Limitations
- Image datasets are supported as a workaround by using a CSV file with image paths. This is not ideal and might eventually be replaced by something else. At the moment, the focus is on tabular data.
- Many features (like custom metrics, models etc) are still dependant on the OpenML Python API, which is in the middle of a major rewrite. Until that is complete, this package will not be able to provide all the features it aims to.
